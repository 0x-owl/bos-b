With the knife blade an intricate diagram is drawn on a flat surface and then the blade is used to kill an animal of at least SIZ 20. The creature's blood is then traced out to follow the lines of the drawn diagram and the enchantment is complete. Such a knife is suitable for use in casting Summon Dimensional Shambler. Every point of POW placed into it adds 1 percentiles to the chance for success in casting that spell. If this knife is used to slay the small animal for Enchant Brazier, the brazier so made adds 10 percentiles to the chance for successfully casting Conjure Glass of Mortlan.",
