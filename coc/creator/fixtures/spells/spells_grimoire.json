The enchanted organ is then removed from the caster’s body, to be hidden away for safekeeping and providing the wizard with a form of invulnerability—as long as the enchanted organ remains safely hidden the wizard will not suffer particular attacks and may even be invulnerable to death. \n This spell was first used by followers of the Dark Pharaoh, Nephren-Ka, who would remove a vital organ, such as the heart or liver, and lock them away in safe places. This would make the caster virtually impossible to kill, if not for the spell’s one weakness. The brain is the seat of the spell’s power and, as such, could not be removed. If the brain was destroyed, the other organs would lose their magical properties and the caster would die. \n Having one’s own insides removed costs 2D10 Sanity points and the permanent loss of 5 POW per organ removed. Attacks that impale cause only normal damage (unless the head is specifically targeted). Invulnerability stems from which organ is removed; for example if the lungs are removed then the caster is unaffected by lack of oxygen (thus drowning and suffocation are no longer threats). Removal of vital organs may also render the caster immune to poison and so forth. \n If the caster is harmed, hit points should be reduced as usual, leading to unconsciousness but not death. Death will only occur if the brain is specifically targeted and destroyed.",

If the INT of the investigator is higher than that of the caster, the caster must win another POW roll every 10 rounds. When the caster fails the spell is broken.",
