      "description": "A successful Luck roll establishes that a servitor is within the Milky Way galaxy when the spell is cast. If no servitor is within that range, the magic points are lost.\nStars must be visible to the caster. He or she attempts to visualize Azathoth’s Ineffable Heart (reputedly a spheroidal symbol of meditation but actually of unknown shape) that pulses and shines like liquid flame. The servitor manifests within 1D6+4 rounds and expects a blood sacrifice. If the nominated sacrifice is inadequate, the servitor devours the caster. If the servitor accepts the sacrifice, it agrees to perform one simple task for the caster.\nWith a successful Persuade roll, the servitor also deigns to answer one respectful question about Mighty Azathoth, the court at the center of the universe or an Outer God. The answer adds 1D3 Cthulhu Mythos to the questioner’s total, but the answer is meaningless to onlookers.\nWith a roll of equal to or less than a fifth of the caster’s Persuade skill, the servitor also imparts a spell directly into the caster’s brain, costing the caster 1D8 Sanity points and 1D10 rounds of disorientation. The servitor chooses the spell.\nIts services rendered, the servitor may linger and play its unearthly pipes while colors flash across its body and its tentacles writhe, or it may dissolve and return to some galactic arm or stellar nursery and resume its previous activity.\nHearing its insane and mesmerizing pipes costs 1/1D4 Sanity points and thereafter haunts every singer or instrumentalist who was present. They become indifferent to earthly scales and more and more feel compelled to perform in the cosmic scales revealed to them.",

Songs are sung and dances danced. An entreaty is made for the dead to appear. Add up all the magic points, multiply the sum by five, with the caster needing to roll equal to or under that result on 1D100. With a success, the voices of the dead emerge from the water jugs. One may hear them and discuss or question them by putting one’s head in the tent. Remember that the dead mostly know only what they knew in life and that some have not realized that they are dead.",
