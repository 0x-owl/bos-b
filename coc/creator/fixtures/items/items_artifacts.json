            "description": "In dangerous situations, mi-go typically don these webs of semi-luminous green slime. The harnesses provides 8 points of armor against blows, flame, electricity, etc. Humans may wear these bio-webs, but take 1 point of damage as hair and flesh is ripped away each time the armor is removed. A bio-web will slowly degrade because humans do not exude the proper nutrient solutions to care for it. Each time it is worn by a human, a bio-web decreases in protection by one point. When no armor points remain, the armor disintegrates into a steaming, sticky pool of viscous matter. Whether there are significant side effects to wearing this armor is unknown.",

            "description": "A mind-bending psychedelic, also known as 'black stygian', used by serpent people as a means of torture to extract information. In minute quantities the lotus powder is a mild hallucinogen, equivalent to magic mushrooms; however in larger doses the drug may reduce those taking it to insane, driveling idiots. The drug can be administered either by injection (the powder when heated turns to liquid) or by inhalation (the black smoke given-off smells like burnt toffee). If more than the usual (recreational) dose is administered, the victim immediately begins to hallucinate for 1D6 minutes per dose. The visions are totally immersive and horrifying, granting insights into the unspeakable knowledge of the Mythos some serpent men claim that it is like looking into the very face of Azathoth. 1D4 Sanity points are lost per minute the drug is active. During this period, the victim is highly susceptible to questioning, readily revealing information and close-kept secrets. Towards the end, the victim's body goes into spasm until collapsing into unconsciousness for 1D10 hours. It is not uncommon for the victim to wake up totally insane. Accounts suggest that the black lotus flower was rare even in the time of famed Valusia and today it is thought the infamous plant is long extinct. However, from time to time, ancient vials and jars have been uncovered containing quantities of black stygian powder. It is unknown, yet presumable, that modern science might be able to analyze the powder's compounds and recreate them.",

Lovecraft described them as, 'a foot high and somewhat less in diameter, with three curious sockets set in an isosceles triangle over the front convex surface.' Each cylinder is filled with a nutrient solution that sustains the brain within. Three accessory machines-a tall rig with twin lenses mounted on front, a box with vacuum-tubes and a sounding board, and a small box with a metal disc on top-comprise the mi-go sensing apparatus. These machines, when connected to the proper sockets, provide the brain with the faculties of sight, speech, and hearing. The mi-go, not possessed of human senses, have done their best; however it is but an approximation of sound and vision. All visual input is grainy, of low general resolution and the audio is flat, like that of a monaural phonograph. Speech, with all its nuances of inflection and emotion, is utterly lost on the fungi. The speech machine talks with a mechanical, monotone voice, devoid of emotion. When the sensory machines are disconnected or deactivated, the encased brain falls into a semi-insane sleep state filled with strange dreams and hallucinations. Every month a human brain is enclosed within a cylinder, the brain must roll under or equal to its INT. If successful, the brain remembers it is stuck inside a tin can and loses 1D3 Sanity points.",

When the device is made active it can be adjusted to pull a deeply buried stratum up through intervening layers of rock. The machine can reach down four to five miles and can affect an area up to one cubic mile in area at a time. However, the machine has the unfortunate side effect of causing earthquakes when it is used. The size and depth of the area affected are directly correlated to the magnitude of the earthquake. For this reason mi-go tend to use such machines only in largely uninhabited areas, to avoid detection.

When it hits, the electric jolt acts like a taser, causing violent muscle spasms that immobilize the victim for a number of rounds equal to the damage inflicted. The target must make a CON roll or fall unconscious for 1D6 rounds-if the roll is fumbled the target suffers cardiac arrest and dies, unless immediate medical intervention is received. Mi-go take normal rolled damage (surface burns to the carapace) from these weapons, but do not have electrical nervous systems and are immune to the other possible effects of damage from the electrical charges. To be able to fire this alien weapon humans must realign the wires on the electric gun, a feat requiring a Hard Electrical Repair roll. So jury-rigged for human use, the weapon fires uncertainly. Roll 1D6 when attempting to fire: the weapon fires only on a result of 1-2. The base chance for a human attacking with the Firearms (Electric Gun) skill is 10%.",

It is a small, slim, rectangular copper box covered with tiny indentations. From one side of the box, five flexible metal tubes extend, ending in inch-long metal needles. The needles are inserted into the victim's head, which takes five rounds. Once the device is activated, the victim is paralyzed unless he or she makes a successful POW roll each round that the device is connected. Each round the machine erases up to a year's worth of memories or removes 5 points of INT, at the operator's discretion. These memories and thoughts are stored in the copper box. The erasure of memories is not always totally complete. Every year there is an INT chance that some memory returns in the form of dreams. The function of this device may also be reversed, feeding the stored memories to the original victim or alternatively to another entity entirely. The tabula rasa device is very complex, and can only be used by those familiar with Yithian technology. Humans ignorant of Yithian technology would require an Extreme INT roll to successful operate the device-failure would indicate that the person connected to the machine has suffered brain damage and the loss of 1D100 INT.",

            "description": "These devices are sometimes supplied to human agents of the Yithians. When assembled, the device stands nearly a foot tall. It is made of bronze and covered with intricate carvings. A red jewel, attuned to a specific Yithian, is embedded into the top of the machine. When power is switched on, the jewel begins to glow red. After a few minutes, contact is established with the Yithian attuned to the jewel. The Yithian may be any distance in time or space. A hologram is projected and the Yithian can see into the time and space occupied by the machine and thus may communicate with those who have contacted it. A Yithian temporal communicator is fairly straightforward to operate, provided that an investigator can understand and determine which carving turns it on.",
