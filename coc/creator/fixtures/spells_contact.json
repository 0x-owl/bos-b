        "description": "Contact spells are divided in to two separate groups: spells concerned with contacting Mythos creatures and monsters and spells for contacting Mythos deities (see Contact Deity).\nUsing Contact spells a cultist could get in touch with intelligent monsters and alien races, perhaps to learn more about history, magic, gods or alien species. The caster should have a definite goal in mind; bargains might be struck, agreements made, plans negotiated.\nContact spells do not give the caster the upper hand though; the spell is merely a method of establishing contact. Remember these are independent and intelligent beings with their own (usually antithetical to human) motivations—casters make contact at their peril! This is distinctly different to Summoning Spells that have the potential to allow casters to bind the summoned beings to their will.\nProcedures are much the same for each Contact spell, though particular conditions or requirements may be unique. Knowing one Contact spell is of no help in casting another. Many versions of Contact spells exist.\nCast properly, this spell always works, unless there are no such things living within a convenient distance (flying polyps might journey from the City in the Sands to some part of Australia, but might ignore the chance to fly to North America).\nA Contact spell takes five to ten rounds to cast. The thing reached by the spell may appear in a game hour or take a game day or more to show up. For a random appearance in hours, roll 1D100. Entities living nearby will walk, swim, dig or fly to the spell point. If the trip is too long, the thing called by the spell never shows up. Things from other dimensions can appear in any characteristic or evocative manner.\nThe spell brings a random member of the species, presumably with its own motives. The caster should try to be alone or to be with no more than a small group, in order not to seem threatening. Once the contacted thing appears, it is free to depart, so if the caster has something to offer it, the chances for an extended meeting greatly improve.\nIf a contacted species is large, such as a flying polyp, only one will likely appear. If it is human-sized or smaller, the Keeper may determine if several representatives arrive as a group.\nThere is no guarantee that a contacted entity would rather bargain than devour the caster. It will have an alien motivation; however, if further contact seems of advantage to both sides, then some interesting roleplaying may emerge.\nAs mentioned, each version of the spell requires certain conditions to be in place for it to work.",

If no servitor is within that range, the magic points are lost.\nStars must be visible to the caster. He or she attempts to visualize Azathoth’s Ineffable Heart (reputedly a spheroidal symbol of meditation but actually of unknown shape) that pulses and shines like liquid flame. The servitor manifests within 1D6+4 rounds and expects a blood sacrifice. If the nominated sacrifice is inadequate, the servitor devours the caster. If the servitor accepts the sacrifice, it agrees to perform one simple task for the caster.\nWith a successful Persuade roll, the servitor also deigns to answer one respectful question about Mighty Azathoth, the court at the center of the universe or an Outer God. The answer adds 1D3 Cthulhu Mythos to the questioner’s total, but the answer is meaningless to onlookers.\nWith a roll of equal to or less than a fifth of the caster’s Persuade skill, the servitor also imparts a spell directly into the caster’s brain, costing the caster 1D8 Sanity points and 1D10 rounds of disorientation. The servitor chooses the spell.\nIts services rendered, the servitor may linger and play its unearthly pipes while colors flash across its body and its tentacles writhe, or it may dissolve and return to some galactic arm or stellar nursery and resume its previous activity.\nHearing its insane and mesmerizing pipes costs 1/1D4 Sanity points and thereafter haunts every singer or instrumentalist who was present. They become indifferent to earthly scales and more and more feel compelled to perform in the cosmic scales revealed to them.",
