        "description": "Such spells concern themselves with alien races and attendants, those monsters that commonly serve greater monsters or wizards. The general procedures for these spells are the same, but conditions may vary from spell to spell. Knowing one such spell is of no use whatsoever in attempting to cast another. Unless the Keeper wishes otherwise, the summon and the bind portions of each spell are learned together. Foolish is the impatient wizard who only learns to summon and not to bind...\nWith the exception of Summon/Bind Servitor of the Outer Gods, these spells require the sacrifice of 1 magic point per 10 percentiles chance for success. For example, 3 magic points gives a 30% chance for the spell to succeed. In general, for each magic point spent, the caster must spend five minutes chanting—the greater the chance for success, the longer the spell takes to cast. A result of 96-100 is always a failure—a rolled result of 100 should always have bad consequences for the wizard concerned.\nThe caster also loses 1D4 Sanity points per spell cast, whether the spell succeeds or not.\nIf a success, one being appears per spell, 2D10 game minutes after the chant concludes. The thing appearing may also require a Sanity loss to see it.\nAs the Keeper wishes, the thing arrives bound or the Keeper may ask that the caster make an opposed POW roll versus the summoned being. With a success, the thing is bound; with a failure, it attacks the caster and then returns from whence it came. Bound, the thing must obey one order by the caster, even to attacking its own kind, after which it is freed and returns from whence it came.",
