In the present day, the skill extends to cover video cameras, video playback equipment, digital photography, and digital editing, where the user is adept at the manipulation of digital images. Radically different versions can be created from an original source, such as changing the location of a person in a photograph, who they are with, and what they are doing. Those proficient may also be able to detect when an image has been manipulated. Regular snapshots do not require a skill roll. Rolls would be required to achieve effective candid photographs, or shots that capture fine detail—especially at long range, at speed, or in low light. This skill can also allow the investigator to determine if a photograph has been tampered with or fabricated, as well as the angle and position from which a photograph was taken."

An academic might be able to calculate orbits, discuss stellar life cycles, and (in the modern day), have knowledge of infrared astronomy, or long-baseline interferometry. America's leading astronomer is Edwin Hubble who, in 1922-24, discovers that nebulae are actually separate galaxies lying far beyond the Milky Way. His discovery in 1929 of 'red shifts' leads to theories about an expanding and ever-dynamic universe. Astronomer Clyde Tombaugh discovers the ninth planet (as it was then classified) of our solar system in 1931, naming it Pluto. The largest telescopes in the world are the 100-inch reflector on Mt. Wilson near Pasadena, California and a 72-inch reflector in Vancouver, British Columbia. A number of astronomical societies exist, publishing journals and newsletters, including: The Royal Astronomical Society (1820); The British Astronomical Society (1869); The American Astronomical Society (1899); The Astronomical Society of the Pacific (1880); and The American Association of Variable Star Observers (1911).

The Science and Philosophy of Organism (1929) by Hans Driesch is an up-to-date reference.

Cracking a code can be painstaking work, often requiring lengthy research and number crunching. Cryptography has a long history, as there have always been people keen to keep information secret. Notable use of cryptography in the period include the ciphers used in the plotting which led to the execution of Mata Hari—an exotic dancer and accused spy who was executed by firing squad in France under charges of espionage for Germany during World War I. Perhaps the most significant event in the runup to the 1920s was the decryption of the Zimmermann Telegram (a message from the German Foreign Office sent to the German ambassador in Mexico) which played a major part in leading America into the Great War."

Gravelle develops the comparison microscope for the identification of fired bullets and cartridge cases. The technique is used to examine shell casings from the Thompson machine guns used in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, eventually leading police to raid the home of Al -Scarface- Capone, where two of the murder weapons are found."

A group of American geologists puts forth the theory that periodic flooding in parts of the world may have been the result of ocean levels rising and falling due to periodic ice ages, rather than a lifting and settling of the continents as previously believed.

In 1921, Albert Einstein is awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. Later in the decade, Neils Bohr, the Danish physicist, discovers the properties of the atom. In 1925 Werner Heisenberg, Max Born and Erwin Schrödinger formulate quantum mechanics, which leads to the theory behind atomic and nuclear science—perhaps the most significant scientific event in the 20th century"

The user could also analyze an unknown substance, given proper equipment and reagents. 1920s Chemistry has become an essential part of most sciences from medicine and pharmacy, to physics and biology. Synthetic substances like Bakelite (the first plastic) are being developed, while chemistry also helps to explain the role of vitamins and hormones. Synthetic replacement medicines, such as Novocaine for cocaine, are being developed, as well as faster film emulsions and stronger alloys. Currently there are 92 elements listed on the Periodic Table."

The skill represents the user's chance to understand, speak, read, and write in a language other than his or her own. Ancient or unknown languages (such as Aklo, Hyperborean, etc.) should not be chosen (unless agreed with the Keeper,) but ordinary Earthly languages may be. The Keeper may raise the difficulty level if archaic speech or writing in that language is encountered. A single successful Other Language roll normally allows comprehension of an entire book. Suggestions regarding the Other Languages skill: 1) At 5% skill a language can be correctly identified without need for a roll. 2) At 10% skill simple ideas can be communicated. 3) At 30% transactional requests can be understood. 4) At 50% skill a person is fluent. 5) At 75% skill in a character can pass for a native speaker of a foreign language. 6) To identify a present-day human language (unknown to the investigator), use an EDU roll. 7) To identify an extinct human language, use an Archaeology or History roll. 8) To identify an alien language, use a Cthulhu Mythos or possibly an Occult roll. Pushing examples: taking longer to think through the words you want to say; taking long pauses to answer what you have been told; referencing other books to make a translation. Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: exaggerated or loud discussions between investigators and third parties alert some enemy faction to the investigators intentions; a word or phrase is misunderstood (perhaps the meaning is reversed); the listener takes offense to an unintentional slur, and they respond with their fists, or turn everyone in the neighborhood against you.

Charm may be used for bargaining, to haggle the price of an item or service down. If successful, the seller is won over and they may well reduce the price a little. Pushing examples: overtly flattering the target with affection; presenting an expensive gift; building trust by imparting a secret. Remember this is about being charming: if the investigator begins to take an alternative approach, the Keeper may ask for a different skill to be used; if threats are used, it may become Intimidation; or if a protracted discussion ensues, it may become Persuasion.

There is no tick-box for Cthulhu Mythos on the investigator sheet, as successful use of the skill does not offer an increase in the investigator's percentiles in the skill. Instead, points in Cthulhu Mythos are gained by encounters with the Mythos that result in insanity, by insane insights into the true nature of the universe, and by reading forbidden books and other Mythos writings.

The skill is opposed by Psychology or Fast Talk. After a brief period (usually after the fast talker has left the scene) the target will realize that they have been conned. The effect of Fast Talk is always temporary, though it will last longer if a Hard success is achieved. Fast Talk may be used to haggle the price of an item or service down. If successful, the seller momentarily thinks that they have struck a good deal; however, if the buyer returns and attempts to purchase another item, the seller may well refuse further haggling and even increase the price in order to recoup what they lost on the previous sale! Pushing examples: getting up close and personal to the target; talking outlandishly, aiming to confuse the target. Remember this is Fast Talk, so if the investigator begins to take an alternative approach, the Keeper may ask for a different skill to be used; if threats are used, it may become Intimidate, or if a protracted discussion ensues, it may become Persuade.

To be effective, First Aid must be delivered within one hour, in which case it grants 1 hit point. It may be attempted once, with subsequent attempts constituting a pushed roll. Two people can work together to administer First Aid, with a success granted if either one of them rolls a success. Successful use of First Aid can rouse an unconscious person to consciousness. A character is limited to one successful treatment of First Aid and Medicine until further damage is taken. When treating a dying character, successful First Aid stabilizes him or her for one hour and grants 1 temporary hit point. At the end of the hour, and each hour thereafter, the character must make a successful CON roll to remain stabilized, otherwise (with a failed CON roll) the character is dying and loses the temporary hit point, and must now make a CON roll per round thereafter to stave-off death. If the character survives until the following round, First Aid can be attempted again (by up to two individuals). This can be continued (without constituting a pushed roll) until stabilization or death. First Aid (and only First Aid) can save the life of a dying character, after which they must receive a successful Medicine roll, or be hospitalized. Thus, First Aid is an important skill to have, alongside Medicine, if you wish to be an effective medic. Pushing examples: taking longer to treat the patient; employing high risk methods to stabilize the wound.

Using hypnosis is usually an opposed roll (opposed by the POW or Psychology skill of the target). This skill may be utilized as hypnotherapy on those suffering mental trauma, reducing the effects of a phobia or mania in a patient: successful use means that the patient overcomes the phobia or mania on one occasion. Note that a series of successful hypnotherapy sessions may be needed to fully cure someone of a phobia (minimum of 1D6 sessions, at the Keeper's discretion). Pushing examples: increasing your influence on the target by ensuring their full and undivided attention; assaulting the target's senses with confusing lights or props; the use of drugs to make the target more susceptible to suggestion.

Intimidate is opposed by Intimidate or Psychology. Backing up intimidation with a weapon or some other powerful threat or incentive may reduce the difficulty level. When pushing an Intimidation roll, one possible consequence of failure is carrying out one's threat, perhaps beyond the level of that which was intended. Intimidate may be used to force down the price of an item or service. If successful, the seller is may reduce the price, or hand the item over free of charge—depending on the situation, they may later report the incident to the police or to members of the local organized crime gang. Pushing examples: Causing actual physical harm to the target or to something or someone that the target cares about. Remember that this is Intimidation; if the investigator begins to take an alternative approach, the Keeper may ask for a different skill to be used.

When falling, Jump may be used to lessen the potential fall damage. Judgment must be exercised as to what constitutes a regular jump, a hard jump, or an extreme jump (respectively requiring Regular success, Hard success, and Extreme success). As a guide, a Regular success would be required for an investigator to safely leap down vertically to his or her own height, jump horizontally from a standing start across a gap for a distance equal to the jumper's own height, or run and then jump horizontally to a distance of twice the jumper's own height. One might achieve double this distance with an Extreme success, although bear in mind the world record for the long jump is around 29 feet. If falling from a height, a successful Jump prepares for the fall, reducing resultant damage by half. Pushing examples: delaying and taking time to assess the jump; throwing all your weight and force behind the jump really stretching for it. In some instances a pushed roll is not possible; if one leaps across an abyss one cannot have a second attempt. However, if one is trapped in a pit and jumping to escape, one could have any number of attempts, which would then be summarized by one pushed skill roll.

Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: information is misremembered, and the ritual is performed incorrectly with disastrous consequences (perhaps the house is burned to the ground); in preparing the circle of protection, you use the wrong ingredients, and rather than ward off the spirits you genuinely summon something malevolent; your research has uncovered a hitherto unknown Mythos link, and your realization shatters your mind (SAN loss). If an insane investigator fails a pushed roll, this is likely to manifest in some form on obsession: perhaps the investigator tattoos occult symbols upon his or her cheeks and palms, or cannot act without first using a scrying crystal to divine their future.",

            "description": "Use Persuade to convince a target about a particular idea, concept, or belief through reasoned argument, debate, and discussion. Persuade may be employed without reference to truth. The successful application of Persuade takes time: at least half an hour. If you want to persuade someone quickly, you should use Fast Talk. Depending on the goal expressed by the player, if the investigator takes sufficient time, the effect may linger indefinitely and insidiously; for years perhaps, until events or another Persuade turn the target's mind in another direction. Persuade may be used for bargaining, to haggle the price of an item or service down. If successful, the seller is thoroughly convinced that they have struck a good deal. Pushing examples: getting close and personal to advance your argument or appeal to the target's reason; demonstrating through logical reasoning and examples, in detail; using carefully preplanned suggestion techniques (possibly also subliminal messages) to make the target as receptive as possible; putting on a grand show (staging, fireworks, free gifts, free drinks, bribes, etc.) in order to really push your point of view front-and-center for a group of people. Remember that this is Persuade; if the investigator begins to take an alternative approach, the Keeper may ask for a different skill to be used. If threats are used, it may become Intimidate; or if the investigator is relying on befriending the target, it may become Charm. Switching from one to the other to gain a second roll still constitutes a pushed roll. Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: the target takes great offence and refuses to have any more to do with you; your bribe worked and the target signed the forms—however in the cold light of morning they feel they have been duped, and now their solicitor has employed a private eye to find out what you're up to, or is suing you for malpractice; the target doesn't like your big talk and, from out of nowhere, they pull a knife on you; you persuaded the security guard to turn a blind eye to your robbery—however they lose their job and, wracked with guilt, they commit suicide (the full implications of your actions hit you and you lose Sanity for causing the death of an innocent).

            "description": "It refers to the range of emotional therapies, not just to Freudian procedures. Formal psychotherapy was still in its infancy in the 1890s, though some procedures are as old as humanity. Sometimes it was looked on as a fraudulent study, even in the 1920s. The common term then for an analyst or scholar of emotional disorders was alienist. In the present day, a combination of therapies has evolved, and this skill now could be justly named Psychiatric Treatment. Intensive psychoanalysis can return Sanity points to an investigator patient. Once per game month, to learn the progress of the therapy, make a 1D100 roll against the analyst or doctor's Psychoanalysis skill. If the roll succeeds, the patient gains 1D3 Sanity points. If the roll fails, add no points. If the roll is fumbled, then the patient loses 1D6 Sanity points, and treatment by that analyst concludes: there has been some sort of serious incident or dramatic setback in the therapy, and the relationship between patient and therapist has broken down beyond saving. In the game, psychoanalysis alone does not speed recovery from indefinite insanity, which requires 1D6 months of institutional or similar care, of which psychotherapy may form a part. Successful use of this skill can allow a character to cope with the subject of a phobia/mania for a short time, or to see delusions for what they are. In play, this would allow for an insane investigator to ignore the effects of a phobia or mania for a brief period, allowing a claustrophobe to hide in a broom cupboard for ten minutes, for example. Equally a person might make a Psychoanalysis roll to help a delusional investigator see through their hallucination for a brief period. Treatment by a psychotherapist can add Sanity points during indefinite insanity. Psychoanalysis cannot increase a person's Sanity points above 99-Cthulhu Mythos. Pushing examples: this is a skill that can be attempted month after month without requiring a pushed skill roll. However, if one failed the skill roll in a given month, one might choose to push a roll during a single session on the following day with some form of radical intervention (if a quick result was required). For example: forcing a patient to face their fear by actively forcing them to confront its physical reality; getting the patient's friends and close colleagues to actively participate in the therapy. Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: curing the patient's fear of spiders by locking them in a room full of tarantulas backfires as the patient goes berserk and now thinks they are the spider king (the patient now has a new mania and has lost additional Sanity points—the therapist should make a Sanity roll too, as their actions caused this!). Much like the blind leading the blind, it is possible for an insane character to practice psychoanalysis. An insane character who fails a pushed roll could seek to become a cult leader, with his/her patients as recruits.",

Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: you somehow reveal your own motivations to the target; the target is offended by your prying questions or curious stare, and refuses to speak with you further, or takes action against you (perhaps violence or a call to the police); unknown to you, the target is connected with your adversaries, and you unwittingly reveal your own agenda to them; spending all week locked in your room in order to build the profile has left you a physical and mental wreck (Penalty die to all rolls until you recover).

Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: the rider is thrown from mount and takes falling damage; mount is injured; rider's foot is entangled in the mount's bridle and the rider ends up being dragged for some distance.

The Keeper should compare the closeness of the die roll result to the highest number which would have indicated success and choose a distance between the target and object that feels comparable. The Throw skill is used in combat when throwing rocks, spears, grenades, or boomerangs. Once an item has been thrown, it is quite literally out of the investigator's hands and therefore there is nothing the player can do to justify a pushed roll. If multiple missiles are available, there is no risk connected with failure, and it is only a matter of time until the investigator is successful, don't roll dice. Pushing examples: taking more time to assess the distance or waiting some time for more favorable conditions; putting every ounce of strength into the throw and throwing yourself as you launch the item; throwing a lot of items in quick succession hoping one will hit the target; taking a massive runup and risking your momentum taking you over the ravine. Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: you send the object flying to your companion as you stumble and fall, the object flying to your companion as you stumble and fall, hard and the object flies over the high church wall into the graveyard; the dynamite stick slips from your hand—you look for it in vain but fail to see it in your hood, and only then do you smell the burning fuse. If an insane investigator fails a pushed roll, he or she will refuse to let go of the item to be thrown.
