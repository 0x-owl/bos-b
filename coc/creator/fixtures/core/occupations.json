Some espouse forms of Christianity while others incorporate Eastern mysticism and occult practices. These groups are particularly familiar to America\\u2019s West Coast but are found all around the country in different forms. The southern Bible Belt supports many traveling tent shows featuring song, dance, and gospel revival.

Local Representatives and Senators elected to state houses enjoy a fair amount of respect, particularly with the business community and often at a statewide level. Governors are responsible for entire states and have connections across the country. Federal positions carry the most clout. States send a number of Representatives to Congress based upon population count, and the House seats over 400 members, each elected to a two-year term. Each state, regardless of size, also sends two Senators to Washington. Elected to six-year terms and numbering less than a hundred, Senators hold considerably more in\\ufb02uence than Representatives, and some elder senators receive nearly as much respect as the President. In the United Kingdom, Members of Parliament are popularly elected every four to five years. Representatives in the House of Lords are unelected, receiving their memberships through either birth or appointment.",

Journalists work for newspapers, magazines, radio, television and Internet news services. The best investigative journalists report, but keep themselves independent of the corruption and self-serving they witness. That reality overwhelms the worst, who eventually forfeit any sensibility except the power of their words. Reporters work in the news and media industries, either freelance or for a newspaper, magazine, website or news agency. Most work outside of the office, interviewing witnesses, checking records and gathering stories. Some are assigned to specific beats like the police station, the sports scene or business. Others cover social events and garden club meetings. Reporters carry \\u2018press passes\\u2019, but these are of little value other than to identify an individual as employed by their respective employer (usually a newspaper). The real work is similar to that of a private detective, and some reporters may resort to subterfuge to gain the information they want.",

Most climbers are weekend and vacation sportsmen; only a few have the reputations needed to attract the financing and sponsorship required for major climbs. By the 1920s, all the major American and Alpine peaks had been conquered. After lengthy negotiations with the Tibetans, climbers were finally been granted access to the highest peaks of the Himalayas. Regular assaults on Mt. Everest, the last unconquered peak in the world, were routinely covered by radio and newspapers. Expeditions in 1921, 1922 and 1924 all failed to reach the summit and resulted in the deaths of thirteen people.

In the U.S., his or her responsibilities at any one time may number in the dozens or hundreds of open cases. The detective\\u2019s crucial function is to marshal enough evidence to allow an arrest, in turn leading to a successful criminal prosecution. Detectives everywhere sort truth from lies by evidence and reconstruction. The offices of detective and prosecutor are separate, so that the evidence may be weighed independently before trial. Though present day detectives may attend police science classes, take a degree and undergo special training and civil service exams, police detectives of every era are grounded in their experiences as junior officers and ordinary patrolmen. The uniformed police officer is employed by cities and towns, by County sheriffs\\u2019 departments, and state or regional police forces. The job may be on foot, behind the wheel of a patrol car or even sitting at a desk.",

As such, psychiatrists sought to establish their medical credentials, and differing perspectives of diagnosing and treating mental disorders began to be introduced.

Some are mainly office-based, working telephones to contact potential clients, while others travel between communities to sell their wares door-to-door. The 1920s is the decade of the entrepreneur, and the traveling salesperson is a part of everyday life. Some work directly for companies and others on consignment, but most live and die by commission, using hard sales tactics to gain the confidence of a potential buyer and not caring whether their sale is affordable or not. Some are restricted to certain territories; however others are free to roam and seek out prospects wherever they might be found. Brushes, vacuum cleaners and encyclopedias are only a few of the many items that be offered door-to-door.",
