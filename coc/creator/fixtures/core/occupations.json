Some espouse forms of Christianity while others incorporate Eastern mysticism and occult practices. These groups are particularly familiar to America’s West Coast but are found all around the country in different forms.

Many physicians are employed by large urban hospitals, allowing them to specialize in areas like pathology, toxicology, orthopedics and brain surgery. Doctors may also serve as part- or full-time Medical Examiners, conducting autopsies and signing death certifcates for the city, county or state. In the U.S., physicians are licensed by individual states, most requiring a minimum of two years’ attendance at an accredited medical school.

Small-town mayors and township supervisors fnd their inﬂuence extends little beyond their municipality’s borders. Often these jobs are part-time, paying but small compensation. The mayors of big cities are well paid, however, often ruling their cities like little kingdoms and wielding more inﬂuence and power than the governor of their respective state. Local Representatives and Senators elected to state houses enjoy a fair amount of respect, particularly with the business community and often at a statewide level. Governors are responsible for entire states and have connections across the country. Federal positions carry the most clout. States send a number of Representatives to Congress based upon population count, and the House seats over 400 members, each elected to a two-year term. Each state, regardless of size, also sends two Senators to Washington. Elected to six-year terms and numbering less than a hundred, Senators hold considerably more inﬂuence than Representatives, and some elder senators receive nearly as much respect as the President. In the United Kingdom, Members of Parliament are popularly elected every four to fve years. Representatives in the House of Lords are unelected, receiving their memberships through either birth or appointment.",

Upon graduation the cadet is promoted to the rank of Army or Marine Second Lieutenant or Naval Ensign, and assigned to a station. Usually such recruits owe the government four years’ active service, after which time they may return to civilian life. Many of the offcers trained this way hold professional commissions and serve as doctors, lawyers or engineers. Those looking for a life’s career in the military may try to get themselves appointed to one of the military academies: the U.S. Army’s West Point or the Navy’s Annapolis, for example. Graduating from one of these schools earns the offcer respect. Once out of school, some offcers opt for special training, such as air pilot. Occasionally, an experienced and exceptionally worthy enlisted man is promoted to Warrant Offcer. Although technically at the bottom of the offcers’ list of ranks, the time and experience required to achieve this promotion carry a respect and reverence far exceeding that of any junior or middle-grade offcer. Most commissions are for life. Even a long-retired offcer has the right to call himself Captain or General.",

        "description":"Parapsychologists do not pretend to enjoy extraordinary powers, but instead spend their efforts attempting to observe, record and study such instances. Sometimes nicknamed “ghost hunters”, they make use of technology to try to capture hard evidence of paranormal activity that may be centered on a person or a location. A major portion of their time is spent debunking fake mediums and mistaken phenomena rather than recording actual evidence. Some parapsychologists will specialize in the study of particular phenomenon, such as extra sensory perception, telekinesis, hauntings and others. Prestigious universities grant no degrees for parapsychology. Standards in the feld are based entirely upon personal reputation, and so the most acceptable representatives tend to hold degrees in related areas—physics, psychology or medicine. Those who choose this path are unusually sympathetic to the notion of invisible mystical powers and in validating that belief to the satisfaction of physical scientists. This would represent an unusual cohabitation of faith and doubt—the parapsychologist may have diffculty separating the conﬂicting desires. A person uninterested in observation, experimentation and proof is not a scientist, though he or she may be an occultist.",

The 1920s is the decade of the entrepreneur, and the traveling salesperson is a part of everyday life. Some work directly for companies and others on consignment, but most live and die by commission, using hard sales tactics to gain the confdence of a potential buyer and not caring whether their sale is affordable or not. Some are restricted to certain territories; however others are free to roam and seek out prospects wherever they might be found. Brushes, vacuum cleaners and encyclopedias are only a few of the many items that be offered door-to-door.",
