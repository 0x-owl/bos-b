# Skills

## Retrieve all Skills but obtain only the uuid for each one of them.

query{
  allSkills{
    edges{
      node{
        uuid
      }
    }
  }
}


## Retrieve one skill by the node uuid

query{
  allSkills(uuid:"175a8b46-7627-46f2-a7ba-6bcc7b69a721"){
    edges{
      node{
        title,
        description,
        defaultValue,
        user{
          id,
          username
        }
      }
    }
  }
}


## Search skill by node id
> Notice the id we have for the elements is different to the id the node has
> this is because the node model wraps around our model given that we use
> relays, maybe in the future this will be different.

query{
  skill(id:"U2tpbGxOb2RlOjE="){
    uuid,
    title,
    description,
    defaultValue
    user{
      id,
      username
    }
  }
}


## Create a skill test

mutation{
  skillMutate(
    input:{
      method: "CREATE",
      user: 1,
      title: "Test",
      description: "Created skill",
      defaultValue: 1
    }){
    skill{
      uuid,
      user{
        username,
        id
      }
      title,
      description,
      defaultValue
    }
  }
}


## Edit skill
> In this scenario we need the uuid to find the skill we want to update
> and we pass the new title that we want to have at our skill

mutation{
  skillMutate(
    input:{
      method: "UPDATE",
      uuid: "faf51587-3187-4a38-9b66-bfd3b846c034",
      user: 1,
      title: "Test-2",
      description: "Update test",
      defaultValue: 0
  }){
    skill{
      uuid,
      user{
        username,
        id
      }
      title,
      description,
      defaultValue
    }
  }
}


## Delete a skill
> In this scenario we pass the method which is DEL that stands for DELETE
> we need to pass the uuid as well so the skill can be find and later deleted.

mutation{
  skillMutate(
    input:{
      uuid: "faf51587-3187-4a38-9b66-bfd3b846c034",
      method: "DELETE",
      user: 1
    }){
    skill{
      uuid,
      user{
        username,
        id
      }
      title,
      description,
